# Torch Playground ðŸ”¥: Where Machines learn, but you don't have to code!

Ever wanted to whip up a killer ML model for prototyping, turn in that assignment just before the deadline, or snag that full-time offer from your internship, but the thought of wrestling with PyTorch syntax makes you break out in hives? Well, fear not! At Torch Playground ðŸ”¥, machines do the learning, and you do the chilling. Train an ML model using just the CLI, with full control over hyperparameters, without writing a single line of code.

Just punch in your training details via the command line, and voila! Your models will train themselves, freeing you up to enjoy the finer things in life. Watch endless cat videos, catch up on that crucial football game, or finally ask your crush out on a dateâ€”all while we handle the mind-numbing coding for you. With our detailed logging and analysis tools, you'll have all the juicy data you need to impress your bosses and maybe even score that next raise.

Don't waitâ€”operators are standing by! Call 999 now to dive into the **Torch PlaygroundðŸ”¥** experience, where the only thing you have to lose is your coding stress!  

### [Testimonials](#testimonials)
> _"Before **Torch PlaygroundðŸ”¥**, my friends called me a nerd and people avoided me at parties. My boss thought I was the fiscal loss, and girls gave me their algebra homework when I asked for their number. Now thanks to **Torch PlaygroundðŸ”¥**, my social life has taken a 180 degree turn. I've gone from the coding loner to a social butterfly, all thanks to **Torch PlaygroundðŸ”¥**!_

## Why Torch Playground ðŸ”¥?
If you've made it out of your laughter into this section, congratulations! I've been through quite a few interviews where the interviewer has a hard time believing I am capable of writing sophisticated code in Python and training models in PyTorch. I do have a [paper repository](https://github.com/S3-Lab-IIT/DiffRed/tree/master) and an [open source NLP project](https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/EduAid) that are much more complex and do a better job at representing my capabilities, but I feel that the broader purpose that those projects serve overshadows the effort I put into authoring their respective code repositories. Therefore, this project is solely made with the purpose of demonstrating that I do know how to use PyTorch and Python. I simply don't bother keeping the syntax in my L1 cache, because I can always _look it up_! (its the 2020s for god's sake!) 


## Features 
While I did manage to turn around [John Smith's](#testimonials) life, this project is still under development, and will continue to remain for the foreseeable future. Sometime in the coming months, I will add a checklist below (and also a User Guide) to keep track of the upcoming features, however I'm not doing that at the moment because there are just too many things I wish to add and a list will only make this README longer!

## Wish to Contribute?
I contribute to this repository every weekend (or whenever else I am free from work). Feel free to find your way through the code, incorporate any cool features, and raise a PR (or even issues). I will surely review it.
